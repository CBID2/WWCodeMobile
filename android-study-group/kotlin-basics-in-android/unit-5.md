# 📚Resources for **Android Basics in Kotlin: Unit 5**

### 🔗 Unit 5 Link:

This unit is based on [https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-5](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-5)

## 📝 NOTES:

Keep your apps working through any disruptions to essential networks or processes for a smooth and consistent user experience.

We have 2 ‘pathways’ for this unit, each with interactive coding portions as follows:

- Learn the fundamentals of relational databases and the basics of reading and manipulating data with SQL queries. You’ll also learn how to work with databases on Android using the Room persistence library and working with Kotlin Flow to handle an asynchronous stream of data.
- Learn how to save user's data in an app using Room to read and write changes to a database. Learn how to use Preferences DataStore to store user preferences in the app. In addition, you will be introduced to the repository pattern to abstract an app's data layer from the rest of the app.

### 💡 Tips for learners:

<aside>
👉🏽 Take this [codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/advanced-kotlin-coroutines?hl=en) in addition to the available resources to better understand Kotlin Flows.

<aside>
👉🏽 Recall the Android app you have been developing over the past fortnight, push yourself to incorporate local storage functionality to it. Instead of directly querying data from an API, implement a caching mechanism to allow access to the data even when the user is offline. Learn how to check for internet connectivity. You can create a new app entirely if you wish.

👉🏽 Learn how to use the android documentation. Read it as you would read a book
