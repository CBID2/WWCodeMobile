Hey Android Devs! ðŸ‘‹Â Letâ€™s learn JETPACK COMPOSE together 

This series will be based on this [Google Codelabs](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-basics#0). Our approach is a hybrid one - we will discuss the content on **Slack** and **Zoom** meetings.

Our plan is to go over a new unit every couple of weeks and we will share our notes on Slack on the channel (`#Android-Study-Group`) on this Github repo. You are encouraged to discuss the unit, share your progress, ask questions and learn together! We will announce our Zoom meetings and session on social media and slack.
