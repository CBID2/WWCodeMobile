## 📝 NOTES:

Learn how to store data locally on the device and keep your apps working through any network disruptions for a smooth and consistent user experience.

We have 3 pathway for this unit, with an interactive coding portion as follows:

- Learn how to use SQL to read and manipulate data in a relational database.We’ll learn:
    - What a database and SQLite are.
    - Read data using `SELECT` statement with aggregate functions and distinct values.
    - How to filter, group, order and limit results.
    - Insert, delete and update data in a database.
- Use the Room library to easily create and use relational databases in an Android.
    - Learn about the powerful and expressive Flow APIs and how to test them.
    - How to use Room library to create, read, update and delete entities with the SQLite database.
    - How to create an `entity`, a data access object `(DAO)`, and `database` classes.
    - How to use a DAO to map Kotlin functions to SQL queries.
- Store simple, key-value pair data with Preferences DataStore in an Android app.
    - User `Jetpack DataStore` to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers.
    - How to create, read and write data, and how to handle exceptions in `Preference Datastore`.
    

### 💡 Tips for learners:

## Reflection Questions:

1. Can you provide examples of scenarios where you would prefer using a Preferences DataStore over other data storage options in an Android app? 
2. What are the advantages of using Jetpack DataStore, particularly when it comes to storing key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers? How does it compare to SharedPreferences?
3. Explore the concept of Flow APIs in Android. How do Flow and LiveData differ, and what advantages does Flow offer when it comes to asynchronous data handling?

## Interview Questions:

- What is SQLite?
- What is the benefit of using ORMs like Room?
- What are the main components of Room?
- How to debug database-related changes in the code?
- What does the DAO do?
- How to test the app’s database?
- How do you determine that the data you are saving needs to be saved in the Database or in Datastore?
- What are the benefits of Datastore vs shared preferences?
- What are the types of Datastores? And when to use them?
