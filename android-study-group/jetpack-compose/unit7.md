# 📚Resources for **Android Basics with Compose: Unit 7**

### 🔗 Unit 7 Link:

https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/unit-7

## 📝 NOTES:

Use Android Jetpack's WorkManager API to schedule necessary background work, such as data backups or fresh content downloads, that keeps running even if the app exits or the device restarts.

We have a single pathway for this unit, with an interactive coding portion as follows:

- Learn when and how to use WorkManager, an API that handles background work that needs to run regardless of whether the application process is still running.:
    - Define long-running tasks that need to run in background work.
    - Add WorkManager to an Android app.
    - Create a Worker object and enqueue work.
    - Create constraints on WorkRequests.
    - Use the Background Task Inspector to inspect and debug WorkManager.

### 💡 Tips for learners:
