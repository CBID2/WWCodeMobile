### 🔗 Unit 3 Link:

https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/unit-3

## 📝 NOTES:

Build apps that display a list of data and learn how to make your apps more beautiful with Material Design. 

Material Design is Google’s open-sourced design system.

We have 3 pathway for this unit, with an interactive coding portion as follows:

- Get deeper in Kotlin. We’ll learn how to:
    - Make reusable Kotlin classes with generics
    - Use `enum` and `data` classes
    - Use high-order functions with collections
- Learn how to build a scrollable list in compose using `Lazy lists` ****and ****`Lazy ****grids` **.**
- In the last pathway, we will learn :
    - Use material theming in our compose apps
    - Add some animations to our apps eg. `spring animation` , `Animate*AsState`
    - Make our apps accessible to more users using TalkBack, Switch access and we’ll learn how to improve our UI accessibility.

### 💡 Tips for learners:

<aside>
👉🏽 Explore using [Flow layouts](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/flow) in compose.

> We are excited to start sharing designs for us to implement using compose. This is to help us build more skills on compose. Be on the look out for those.

## 🤔 Reflection Questions:

- Summarize how you’d use an enum class and how you initialize it in Kotlin.
- What is a Composable and how would you use it? What’s a modifier to a composable? Use an example.
- What are some things you can add to your app under material theming through Jetpack Compose?
