## üìù¬†NOTES:

- Overview of the Android platform and its key components: Android is a mobile operating system used by millions of devices worldwide. It has a rich set of APIs and tools to build apps for multiple form factors, including smartphones, tablets, and wearables.
- Role of Kotlin in Android development: Kotlin is a modern programming language that is now officially supported by Google for Android development. It offers improved syntax, null safety, and other features that make it a great choice for Android development.
- We have 4 ‚Äòpathways‚Äô (sections) for this unit, each with interactive coding portions.

## üí°¬†Tips for learners:

 Before diving into the course, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of programming concepts and basic math. Setting up the development environment:

- Installing Android Studio: Android Studio is the official IDE for Android development. It provides a rich set of tools for developing, testing, and deploying Android apps.
- Creating a new Android project: In Android Studio, you can create a new Android project by choosing "Start a new Android Studio project" from the welcome screen or from the File menu. Fill in the required information and select the desired options, such as the minimum API level and the target device form factor.
- Exploring the project structure and default files: A new Android project has a defined structure that includes the main source code, resource files, and the AndroidManifest.xml file, which describes the app and its components.

## ü§î¬†Reflection Questions:

1. Can you describe the steps you took to build a simple user interface in Android?
2. What were the skills you gained from this unit that you can apply in future Android dev projects?
