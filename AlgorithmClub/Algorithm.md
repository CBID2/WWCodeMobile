### Week 37
```
Given a string 's' of even length, split it into two halves of equal lengths, and let 'a' be the first half and 'b' be the second half.

Two strings are alike if they have the same number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Note that 's' contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return true if a and b are alike. Otherwise, return false.

### Week 38 
```
"An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

An array nums is monotone increasing if for all i <= j, nums[i] <= nums[j].  An array nums is monotone decreasing if for all i <= j, nums[i] >= nums[j].

Return true if and only if the given array nums is monotonic."

### Week 39 
```
Given two integers left and right, return a list of all the self-dividing numbers in the range [left, right].
A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.
For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.
A self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.
Example 1:
Input: left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,22]
Example 2:
Input: left = 47, right = 85
Output: [48,55,66,77]
```

### Week 40 
```
Given an integer n, return all the structurally unique BST's (binary search trees), which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n. Return the answer in any order.
Example:
Input: n = 3
Output: [[1,null,2,null,3],[1,null,3,2],[2,1,3],[3,1,null,null,2],[3,2,null,1]]
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 8
