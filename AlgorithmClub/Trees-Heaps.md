### For September, we will learn about Trees data structures. 

A Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. There are many types of Trees, for example, Binary Trees, one of the most common. 
Binary Tree is defined as a Tree data structure with at most 2 children. 
Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child. 
Another tree is a heap which is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property.
There are also other well-known trees you should be familiar with.
