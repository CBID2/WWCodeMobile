# WWCodeMobile Projects 

This repo contains projects and information from our sessions.

The Mobile technical track of Women Who Code is a community dedicated to inspiring women to excel in their technology careers as mobile software engineers. We bring together women from all over the world for deep-dive online learning opportunities. Our free monthly webinars cover various topics around mobile technologies.

* We have a growing Slack channel! WWCodeMobile hosts an ongoing Swift study group. We also post weekly dev news featuring developer updates, community news, ApplaudHers, relevant job postings, and coding resources.
