## Learn more about Women Who Code Mobile

The Mobile technical track of Women Who Code is a community dedicated to inspiring women to excel in their technology careers as mobile software engineers. We bring together women from all over the world for deep-dive online learning opportunities. Our free monthly webinars cover various topics around mobile technologies.

We have a growing Slack channel! WWCodeMobile hosts an ongoing Swift study group. We also post weekly dev news featuring developer updates, community news, ApplaudHers, relevant job postings, and coding resources.
Here are just some of the ways the #WWCodeMobile track is helping to give back to our community:

## Code of Conduct
Women Who Code (WWCode) is dedicated to providing an empowering experience for everyone who participates in or supports our community. Our events are intended to inspire women to excel in technology careers, and anyone who is there for this purpose is welcome. Because we value the safety and security of our members and strive to have an inclusive community, we do not tolerate harassment of members or event participants in any form. This Code of Conduct was created to clearly define what we mean by a harassment-free experience, so that our community and those who support it are clear about our intent and have access to procedures for addressing issues, should they arise.
