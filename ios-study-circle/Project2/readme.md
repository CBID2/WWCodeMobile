You can share your project solutions inside this folder or share links to your Github projects.

Using the api from https://sunrise-sunset.org/api and https://github.com/AsyncSwift/AsyncLocationKit, write a simple swiftui app that detects your current location and shows the sunset and sunrise times. 
You would use async/await for all the networking call for the api and use the AsyncLocationKit to using async/await for getting the permission and location.
Take a good look of async and await is also implemented in https://github.com/AsyncSwift/AsyncLocationKit
