- Learning Sessions & Rush Requests
    - If you have an active paid apple developer account, you have 2 free learning sessions with apple developers throughout the year. Learning sessions can be done through webex or email and you can ask them about anything. To access them, you can do so through the apple developer app. You also get maybe 1 or 2 ‚Äúrush‚Äù requests when submitting App Store builds in which you need the app store to review build as soon as possible like if you‚Äôre fixing a critical bug.
