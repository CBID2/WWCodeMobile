# Chapter 1 - **A Pragmatic Philosophy (5th Jan, 2023)**

What distinguishes Pragmatic Programmers? How can you be pragmatic? How can you make intelligent compromises and informed decisions?

**Tip 1: Care About Your Craft**

Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?

**Tip 2: Think! About Your Work**

Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.

## What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?

1. **Early/ fast Adopter**¬†‚Äî They love trying new things out & can grasp them as quickly as possible.
2. **Inquisitive**¬†‚Äî They are always ready to ask the question to the things they struggle to understand. 
3. **Critical Thinker**¬†‚Äî It‚Äôs hard for them to go with the flow, they always smell a challenge when they hear ‚Äúbecause that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs done‚Äù.
4. **Realistic**¬†‚Äî They tend to understand the underlying nature of each problem they face.
5. **Jack of all trades**¬†‚Äî They don‚Äôt want to stick themselves to a certain technology, they always look to expand their spectrum of knowledge.

Take responsibility for every- thing you do. 
*The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak.*

Despite thorough testing, good documentation, and solid automation, things go wrong. Deliveries are late. Unforeseen technical problems come up. These things happen, and we try to deal with them as professionally as we can. This means being honest and direct. We can be proud of our abilities, but we must be honest about our shortcomings‚Äîour ignorance as well as our mistakes.

**Tip 3: Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses**
Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation.

üí° How do you react when someone‚Äîsuch as a bank teller, an auto mechanic, or a clerk‚Äîcomes to you with a lame excuse? What do you think of them and their company as a result?

## 2. Software Entropy

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b6dbed33-ca23-4509-80f0-769ee838fd98/Untitled.png)

*Entropy*¬†is a term from physics that refers to the amount of ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù in a system. Unfortunately, the laws of thermo- dynamics guarantee that the entropy in the universe tends toward a maximum. When disorder increases in software, programmers call it ‚Äúsoftware rot.‚Äù

**A Broken Window Theory**

According to this theory, one broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment‚Äîa sense that the powers that be don't care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins. In a relatively short space of time, the building becomes damaged beyond the owner's desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment becomes reality.

**Tip 4: Don't Live with Broken Windows**
Don't mess up the carpet when fixing the broken window.

<aside>
üí° Can you tell when a window first gets broken? What is your reaction? If it was the result of someone else‚Äôs decision or a management edict, what can you do about it?

## 3. Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

To overcome ‚Äústart-up fatigue‚Äù, bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say "of course, it would be better if we added‚Ä¶."

**Tip 5: Be a Catalyst for Change**
*People find it easier to join an ongoing success.*

Most software disasters start out too small to notice, and most project overruns happen a day at a time. If you take a frog and drop it into boiling water, it will jump straight back out again. However, if you place the frog in a pan of cold water, then gradually heat it, the frog won't notice the slow increase in temperature and will stay put until cooked.

Don't be like the frog. Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what‚Äôs happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.

**Tip 6: Remember the Big Picture**

<aside>
üí° The soldiers progressively deceive the villagers, but the change they catalyze does them all good. However, by progressively deceiving the frog, you‚Äôre doing it harm. Can you determine whether you‚Äôre making stone soup or frog soup when you try to catalyze change? Is the decision subjective or objective?

## 4. Good-Enough Software

![https://media.giphy.com/media/ZHV5qmqW75UuSvnTYe/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZHV5qmqW75UuSvnTYe/giphy.gif)

*Striving to better, oft we mar what‚Äôs well.*

The scope and quality of the system you produce should be specified as part of that system's requirements.

**Tip 7: Make Quality a Requirements Issue**

Great software today is often preferable to perfect software tomorrow.¬†**Know When to Stop.**

Don‚Äôt spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and over-refinement. It may not be perfect. Don‚Äôt worry: it could never be perfect.

<aside>
üí° Look at the manufacturers of the software tools and operating systems that you use. Can you find any evidence that these companies are comfortable shipping software they know is not perfect? As a user, would you rather 
(1) wait for them to get all the bugs out, 
(2) have complex software and accept some bugs, or 
(3) opt for simpler software with fewer defects?

Consider the effect of modularization on the delivery of software. Will it take more or less time to get a monolithic block of software to the required quality compared with a system designed in modules? Can you find commercial examples?

## 5. Your Knowledge Portfolio

![https://media1.giphy.com/media/9JrkkDoJuU0FbdbUZU/giphy.gif](https://media1.giphy.com/media/9JrkkDoJuU0FbdbUZU/giphy.gif)

*An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.*

- Serious investors invest regularly‚Äîas a habit.
- Diversification is the key to long-term success.
- Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk,high-reward investments.
- Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
- Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically

### Building Your Portfolio

- Invest regularly
- Diversify
- Manage risk
- Buy low, sell High
- Review and rebalance

**Tip 8: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio**

### Goals

- Learn at least one new language every year.
- Read a technical book each quarter.
- Read nontechnical books, too.
- Take classes.
- Participate in local user groups.
- Experiment with different environments.
- Stay current.
- Get wired.

You need to ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype.

If you can‚Äôt find the answer yourself, find out who¬†*can*.

**Tip 9: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear**

### So, how do you find one, and how do you get one to talk with you?

- Know exactly what you want to ask, be specific
- Frame your question carefully and politely. Remember that you‚Äôre asking a favor; don‚Äôt seem to be demanding an answer.
- Once you‚Äôve framed your question, stop and look again for the answer. Pick out some keywords and search the Web.
- Decide if you want to ask publicly or privately. Use a meaningful subject line the decision is to use e-mail. (‚ÄúNeed Help!!!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt cut it.)
- Sit back and be patient. People are busy, and it may take days to get a specific answer.
- Please be sure to thank anyone who responds to you. And if you see people asking questions you can answer, play your part and participate.

## 6. Communicate

![https://media.giphy.com/media/1wQOb1tJgwoGeZNhyW/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/1wQOb1tJgwoGeZNhyW/giphy.gif)

*I believe that it is better to be looked over than it is to be overlooked.*

- Know what you want to say. Plan what you want to say. Write an outline.
- Know your audience. (WISDOM acrostic)
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-01-02 at 11.45.59 AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/81e3aeda-299c-4d03-8d5b-b14614e71d12/Screenshot_2023-01-02_at_11.45.59_AM.png)
    
- Choose your moment: Understanding when your audience needs to hear your information.
- Choose a style: Just the facts, large bound reports, a simple memo.
- Make it look good: Add good-looking vehicle to your important ideas and engage your audience.
- Involve your audience: Get their feedback, and pick their brains.
- Be a listener: Encourage people to talk by asking questions.
- Get back to people: Keep people informed afterwards.

**Tip 10: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It**

### **E-Mail Communication**

- Proofread before you hit¬†SEND¬†. Check the spelling.
- Keep the format simple.
- Use rich-text or¬†HTML¬†formatted mail only if you know that all your recipients can read it. Plain text is universal.
- Try to keep quoting to a minimum. No one likes to receive back their own 100-line e-mail with ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù tacked on.
- If you‚Äôre quoting other people‚Äôs e-mail, be sure to attribute it, and quote it inline (rather than as an attachment).
- Don‚Äôt flame unless you want it to come back and haunt you later.
- Check your list of recipients before sending.
- Archive and organize your e-mail‚Äîboth the important stuff you receive and the mail you send.

## Summary:

### Topic 1: It‚Äôs Your Life üí™

- In this field, we have the ability to make so many changes to how we work. You have the agency to ‚Äòchange your organization (company) or change or *organization* (self).‚Äô
    
    > **Reflection Q: Are there any changes you‚Äôre looking forward to in your career‚Äî what is one and how would you like to reach that?**
    > 

### Topic 2: Things Go Wrong Sometimes üò∞

- How you deal with issues in an honest way matters.
- The trust of your team is essential, and it‚Äôs tough to regain it after it‚Äôs been fractured. Try to take responsibility when things aren‚Äôt going to plan on your projects.
- Offer options instead of excuses. What are some workarounds to your issue, is there anyone we can consult for some insight?
- When you find yourself saying ‚Äúidk‚Ä¶,‚Äù be sure to add the ‚Äúbut I‚Äôll find out.‚Äù Then follow up on it next time!

### Topic 3: Is the Code Buggy (or getting buggier)? üëæ

- How do you fight against software entropy? Tip: Fix bugs when you find them as soon as the team can. Avoid reworking more than the issue (or the codebase entirely) because of a few issues.
    
    > **Reflection Q: Have you fixed any bugs in work or a project recently? Can you briefly describe the issue and did you end up keeping up with the project/code afterward?**
    > 

### Topic 4: The Allegories of Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs üç≤

- On ‚ÄòStone Soup‚Äô: Make a good base product. then have others suggest improvements. Work with them and let them contribute to the pot. sometimes people try to conserve their resources due to ‚Äústand-up fatigue." Speak others curiosity and it may help you. is this a tad manipulative? Yes and that's not necessarily a terrible thing here to get the job done.
- On Frogs: Don't become a boiled one! Constantly review what's happening around you, not just what you're doing. üê∏
- Notice your surroundings in the team when you're on a project.
    
    > **Reflection Q: What does it mean to become a ‚Äòboiled frog‚Äô to you? If you‚Äôve ever felt stressed over a task, how do you re-evaluate?**
    > 

### Topic 5: Good-Enough Software üë©‚Äçüíª

- It's better to put something out today than it is to entertain the fantasy of some perfect software tomorrow.
- "Does the program meet the client's requirements?‚Äù ‚úÖ
- Don't let the program become lost in its features.
    
    > **Reflection Questions:**
    > 
    
    > **Any software you know that suffers from *feature bloat*, specifically?**
    > 

### Topic 6: Your Knowledge üìà

- Keep improving. Cross-pollinating ideas is important. Try to avoid listening only to media or vendor hype; take information from multiple sources.

Author‚Äôs Tips:

- Learn a new language every year.
- Read a tech-related book every month.
- Join classes locally or go to trade shows in the field.
- Experiment with different environments (IDEs, dashboards, etc)
- Read news about new tech and languages.
- Consulting trick: Ask ‚Äòwhy‚Äô five times. For example in evaluating ‚Äòbest practices‚Äô¬† ask:
    - Best for who?
    - What are the prerequisites?
    - What are the consequences (short and long-term)?
    - When or where would this work?
    - Why is this a problem?

### Topic 7: Communication üé§

- Work out your audience's priorities. Ask them questions about *them*. Choose a speech style depending on the audience.
- If you wouldn't say it to someone's face, don't say it online. ü§ó
