## The Seven Habits of Highly Effect People  
**By Stephen Covey**   

A discussion guide to accompany the Women Who Code Mobile Book Club.

### Habit One: Be Proactive
**Starting Oct 4, 2021**

**Inside-Out Section - Discussion Question 1:**  
What’s the difference, as Stephen Covey describes it, between the Personality and Character Ethics? Does that distinction have relevance to your life? According to Covey, what is the disadvantage of relying solely on the Personality Ethic?

**Inside-Out Section - Discussion Question 2:**  
What does the experiment using the drawing of a younger  and  an  older  woman  tell  us  about  individual perception? Talk about how personal conditioning colors perspective in your own experiences. How difficult is it to achieve objectivity — in life generally and in your own life?

**Inside-Out Section - Discussion Question 3:**   
Covey says that to change, “we must look at the lens through which we see the world.” How are you able to do this? How can we become more aware of our lenses (paradigms)? What’s a positive paradigm you have toward working with your colleagues? How does this paradigm affect your behavior and your relationships with clients? What’s a paradigm regarding your work that sometimes hurts your efforts and your results? What can you do to change it?

**Inside-Out Section - Discussion Question 4:**   
It’s important to stay focused on strengths, which everyone has, and on how we can focus or apply these strengths. What’s one of your strongest character attributes? What’s an example of how you’ve demonstrated this attribute with friends and family? What about with  colleagues and clients?

**Inside-Out Section - Discussion Question 5:**   
One page lists a litany of complaints, each ending with “hands thrown up in the air” resignation. Was there a time in your life when you’ve felt that way? Do you perhaps feel that way right now? What was your mindset to cause those feelings, and how does it affect your behavior? What price are you paying because of this way of thinking? What might be the payoff if you could  change  your  thinking  and  your  behavior?

### Habit Two: Begin With The End In Mind

### Habit Four: Think Win-Win

### Habit Five: Seek First To Understand Then Be Understood
