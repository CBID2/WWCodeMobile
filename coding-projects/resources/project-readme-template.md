TODO: Create a README template that can be used for all the coding projects.

This should be implemented as part of [issue 53](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/WWCodeMobile/issues/53)

Review [slides](slides/GettingStartedWithOpenSourceMaintenance.pdf) from the open source maintainers workshop and the issue for guidance on creating this README template.
