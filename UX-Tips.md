**Remove Distractions!**     

When working on a screen or flow, it’s important to keep in mind that the amount of time people are able to concentrate on a task without becoming distracted is very short. In fact, the average person’s attention span is 8 seconds. We should therefore try to provide users with the information that they need to see as quickly as possible. We can do this by simplifying interfaces and removing unnecessary elements or content that does not support user tasks.     

**Recognition Over Recall**      

The human memory tends to have an easier time recognizing something than it does recalling it. Think of the exams you took in school - the multiple choice questions always seemed to be easier to solve, as all you had to do was recognize the right answer, instead of having to think of it from scratch. This same concept can be applied to the screens we create. Instead of asking users to list things out from memory, show users a list of common entries and allow them to select the one/s that apply.     

Instead of making users recall their biggest sources of distractions, this app provides prompts that users can choose from, making it easier for them to remember.

**Error Prevention**      

Making mistakes is very common, but is often a source of frustration for people. Luckily, in the mobile world we can help to eliminate much of this frustration by preventing users from making errors even before they happen. Since anticipating mistakes is less frustrating than trying to fix them after the fact, preventing errors before they occur will make for a better experience.   

Some examples of how this can be accomplished:
Ask users to confirm that they would like to delete an item before deleting it.
Verify that an input has been entered correctly before allowing users to complete a form.
Use inactive states for “next” buttons until the user has completed the required task(s).      

**Don't reinvent the wheel**    

Users don’t always like change. They’re used to the conventional mode of presentation and generally prefer not to have to adapt to something new. That’s why it’s better to use tried and tested layouts throughout a product with minor tweaks to fit your particular goals. This approach enables users to feel more comfortable with your app and lets them use it without getting annoyed by unfamiliar layouts.     

For example, there’s no reason to relocate a drawer menu from the top of a screen to the bottom or change how users proceed in a mobile application. Sticking to tried and tested patterns saves your energy for those instances where design innovation really matters.    

**Error Messages**     

Ever used an app and received a vague error message such as “failure - error 4693”? While technically worded error messages such as this one can be deciphered by developers, they are quite confusing for users. To avoid the frustration that inevitably arrives from such confusion, make error messages short and clear using easy to understand language. Try to help the user understand what they can do to resolve the error.     

For example: “Couldn’t create account because this email address is already in use”. It's also helpful to display these messages in a color that is associated with errors such as orange or red.

**Notifications**    

Don't assault your users with notifications. Notification-abusive apps are like that annoying friend who keeps calling and just can’t take a hint that you're too busy to talk.     

Instead, use notifications sparingly and strategically at moments when the user will appreciate them. It is also helpful to provide notification settings, so that users can tailor their notifications to their specific needs and priorities.      

**Text Alignment**     

Your text alignment can have a major impact on the readability of your content. When you use center-aligned text, the starting place of each line changes, making it more difficult for the eye to follow. Instead use left-aligned text, where the text creates a straight left edge that forms a line to the readers eye, making for an easier and more enjoyable reading experience.
